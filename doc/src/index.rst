Welcome to MiStaMover's documentation!
======================================

**MiStaMover** is an open-source python-based tool that aims to simplify the transfer of large datasets between remote servers. As the name indicates, MiStaMover is able to **Mirror, Stage and Move data**. The tool was developed to support the UK academic research community manage its data effectively between key institutions, computing sites and data centres. But hopefully it can help anyone with a need to mirror, stage or move files.
